# My Student Financial Tracker

## Why I Built This
As a student, managing money can be overwhelming. Between buying textbooks, grabbing coffee during study sessions, paying for subscriptions, and trying to save some money from part-time work, it's easy to lose track of where our money goes. I created this Financial Tracker to help fellow students:

- Monitor food and grocery spending
- Manage part-time job earnings
- Save for important academic needs
- Balance entertainment expenses
- Understand where money is actually going

## What This App Does
1. **Track Your Money**
   - Add your income (part-time job, allowance, etc.)
   - Record your expenses
   - See where your money is going
   - Update or remove entries if you make a mistake

2. **See Your Financial Picture**
   - View your total savings
   - Check monthly spending
   - See which categories (food, books, etc.) cost the most
   - Track your daily spending
